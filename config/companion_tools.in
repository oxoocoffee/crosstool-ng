      Crosstool-NG relies on some external tools to be recent enough, namely:
        make >= 3.81
        m4 >= 1.4.12
        autoconf >= 2.63
        automake >= 1.10.2
        libtool >= 2.2.4
      
      If your system has older versions, we can build them for you,
      but you are strongly encouraged to update your system instead!

config COMP_TOOLS_FOR_HOST
    bool
    prompt "Install companion tools for host"
    help
      Enable this option if you want to include the selected companion
      tools into the final toolchain (rather than just using them
      to build it).
